*Bank Account Manager (Core Java Project)

This is a simple **Bank Account Management System** developed using **Core Java**.  
It helps to perform basic banking operations such as creating a new account, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balance, and viewing customer details.  
The project uses **HashMap** to store and manage multiple bank accounts efficiently.

The system runs in the **console (command line)** and allows the user to interact with different banking options using a simple text-based menu.  
It is designed to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and modularity.

*Objective

The main aim of this project is to understand how real-world banking operations can be implemented in Java using:
- Object-oriented concepts
- Data structures like **HashMap**
- User input using the **Scanner** class
- Simple menu-driven programs for interaction

This project can be used as a mini-project or learning example for Java beginners.

*Features

1. **Create New Account** – Allows the user to create a new customer account with personal and account details.  
2. **Deposit Money** – Add funds to an existing account.  
3. **Withdraw Money** – Withdraw money if sufficient balance is available.  
4. **Check Balance** – View account holder’s details and current balance.  
5. **List All Accounts** – Display all stored customer accounts.  
6. **Exit Program** – End the application safely.

*Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java (Core Java)
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- **Data Structure:** HashMap (for storing multiple accounts)
- **Concepts Used:** Classes, Objects, Methods, Encapsulation, and Scanner class

* How to Run in VS Code

1. **Install Java JDK** (version 17 or above)
2. **Install VS Code**
3. **Install Java Extensions**  
   (Extension Pack for Java, Debugger for Java, Language Support for Java)
4. Create a folder named `BankAccountManager` and add all `.java` files:
